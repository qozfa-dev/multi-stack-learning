## Variables in JavaScript

Variables store data.  
There are three ways to declare variables:

1. **let**

   Used for variables that can be reassigned.

2. **const**

   Used for variables that cannot be reassigned.

3. **var**

   This is no longer common in modern JavaScript - avoid it.  
   It can be reassigned, but it's not recommended.
